                    <p>Requirements:<br>As this was a Dissertation project, requirements were quite broad in order to fit in for the variety of project attempted by students, however they can be summarised as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="in">Create a poster showcasing your project</li>
                        <li class="in">Conduct a Literature review (up to 3000 words)</li>
                        <li class="in">Discuss design, development, testing and results in a report</li>
                        <li class="in">Demo the project at a live showcase day</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Approach and development:</p>
                    <p class="in">Stage 1: As per the requirements, my first step was working on the literature review, where I looked at multiple angles, I studied colour in art, psychology and physics. This set me a solid foundation and understating on the topic and narrowed down my idea.</p>
                    <p class="in">Stage 2: I further developed my initial idea from Stage 1 and decided to attempt measuring peoples’ colour perception. The way this would happen is with an experiment requiring a projection of a rainbow from a prism (recreating Newton’s experiments) to a sheet of tracing paper, this way participant can mark for example, the ranges of a specific colour for them. After gathering this piece of information I would able to stack the findings on top of each other and compare.</p>
                    <p class="in">Stage 3: This step was all about finding the correct setup for having the best (brightest and widest) rainbow. There were 4 iterations consisting of trying different sources of light, lenses and adjustments in order to achieve the best and most consistent conditions.</p>
                    <p class="in">Stage 4: Last but not least, I had testing with people. Because I followed the Design thinking method after the first set, I would tweak the setup, after observing and asking for feedback. Then I did a second test as well.</p>
                    <p class="in">Stage 5: Future steps and Demo: Because the setup was taking a whole room, my intention was to make it smaller and pre-set, this way the setup between tests would be consistent (something that was not the case before, as even the tiniest change in the position of the prism, light or distance to the  projection of the rainbow would produce a different result from the previous setup).</p>

            <p>Results:</p><br>
            <p>Although there were only 12 testers and this is a low number to conclude definite findings, some trends were set. The most interesting finding was that people could tell the difference between yellow and orange with 75% matching results, this trend, although not to the same % was found in a research from 2001 as well.</p>
